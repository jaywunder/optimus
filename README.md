# Is OPTIMUS prime?

A python script to find if a given number is string in some base.

Just modify the `string` variable at the top of the file, then run `python3 optimus.py`

# Why?
At CS Crew we were wondering if different numbers were prime. `1337` is not prime in base 10, but `31337` is prime in base 10 for example.

However `1337` is prime in base 12. yay! :smile:
